# Competetive-Programming
This is my personal DSA journey I'm venturing to brush up old skills and always stay ahead of my own previous self. This repository contains Recursion problems that I have solved on my own, recursion helps us come up with code which is easier to comprehend and understand. But in an enterprise project try to avoid recursion and stick to loops because not only recursion uses more memory as it creates activation record on every function call made, we will lose out on the performance enhancements that loops are equipped with.


You can find problems and solutions from LeetCode, HackerRank. Codeforces etc.
